# ECON408 Winter 20XX
- It is strongly suggested to get GitHub's [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which gives you lots of free stuff (and even access to the AI [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart) )
- Optionally, select `Watch` at the top of this repository to be alerted to all file changes

## Syllabus
See [here](syllabus.md) for more details, a course outline, and grading information.

## Problem Sets and Exams

1. **Due Midnight PST on January 14th** - Problem Set 0. This is a pass/fail problem set (i.e., hand it in you pass!) just to ensure you have setup your computer properly  <!-- [Problem Set 0](/problem_sets/problem_set_0.ipynb) -->
2. **Due Midnight PST on TBD** - Problem Set 1 <!-- [Problem Set 1](/problem_sets/problem_set_1.ipynb) -->
3. **Due Midnight PST on TBD** - Problem Set 2 <!-- [Problem Set 2](/problem_sets/problem_set_2.ipynb) -->
4. **Reviewing around February 14th** - Midterm Practice Problems  <!--[Midterm Practice Problems](/problem_sets/midterm_practice_problems.ipynb) -->
5. **HOLD February 14th or 28th** - MIDTERM EXAM IN CLASS
6. **Due Midnight PST on TBD** - Problem Set 3 <!--  [Problem Set 3](/problem_sets/problem_set_3.ipynb) -->
7. **Due Midnight PST on TBD** -  Problem Set 4 <!-- [Problem Set 4](/problem_sets/problem_set_4.ipynb) -->
8. **Due Midnight PST on TBD** -  Problem Set 5 <!-- [Problem Set 5](/problem_sets/problem_set_5.ipynb) -->
9. **Due Midnight PST on TBD** -  Problem Set 6 <!-- [Problem Set 6](/problem_sets/problem_set_6.ipynb) -->
10. **Reviewing TBD** - Final Practice Problems <!-- [Final Practice Problems](/problem_sets/final_practice_problems.ipynb) -->

All problem set solutions should be submitted on Canvas directly as a `.ipynb` file with instructions embedded.

## Software and Programming Environment
For the computational environment, it is strongly suggested to install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as well as Jupyter.  Familiarity with those tools will make it easier for future work in industry or as research assistants.  See [here](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/getting_started.html) to setup your environment.

While we will be using a computer for simulations and numerical solutions to our models, this is an economics course.  If you have the prerequisites, then **do not be scared off by the programming requirements!**  Relative to many classes, the coding will be kept simple.  The hard part will be the economic and finance theory.

This course is being taught with [Julia](https://julialang.org/), and you will be expected to use that language.  Writing your code in Matlab or Python is not possible (and R is inappropriate for this sort of material).  

### Programming Language
If you are scared that you don't know Julia, don't worry: **the first programming language is the hardest and it Julia will come easily if you have the prerequisities** (i.e. a course using Matlab or Python, sadly R is not sufficient preparation).

There are good reasons to learn at least two programming languages regardless of which ones they are:  it makes you better at both, and easier to pickup a third - even if you only end up using Python in the longrun.  Most important, on CVs when applying for jobs everyone already says they know Python, so it becomes a major differentiator to be able to say you know other serious computational languages - and Julia is as good as any for that purpose.

Julia itself has some advantages in economics and finance: (1) while Python is great for datascience and machine learning, it is harder and verbose to use for simulations and computational methods than it first appears; (2) Julia is much more natural for programming mathematics and linear algebra than Python and closer to Matlab; (3) many research economists and finance research use Julia for computational methods, so it helps you to work as as RA or to get a job as a predoc.
