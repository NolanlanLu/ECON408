It is strongly suggested to get GitHub's [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which gives you lots of free stuff (and even access to the AI [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart) ). Optionally, select `Watch` at the top of this repository to be alerted to all file changes

## Syllabus
See [here](syllabus.md) for more details, a course outline, and grading information.

## Problem Sets and Exams

1. **Due Midnight PST on January 17th** - [Problem Set 0](/problem_sets/problem_set_0.ipynb)
   - This is a pass/fail problem set (i.e., hand it in you pass!) just to ensure you have setup your computer properly 
2. **Due Midnight PST on TBD** - Problem Set 1 <!-- [Problem Set 1](/problem_sets/problem_set_1.ipynb) -->
3. **Due Midnight PST on TBD** - Problem Set 2 <!-- [Problem Set 2](/problem_sets/problem_set_2.ipynb) -->
4. **Due Midnight PST on TBD** - Problem Set 3 <!--  [Problem Set 3](/problem_sets/problem_set_3.ipynb) -->
5. **Review February 26th** - Midterm Practice Problems  <!--[Midterm Practice Problems](/problem_sets/midterm_practice_problems.ipynb) -->
6. **February 28th** - MIDTERM EXAM IN CLASS
7. **Due Midnight PST on TBD** -  Problem Set 4 <!-- [Problem Set 4](/problem_sets/problem_set_4.ipynb) -->
8. **Due Midnight PST on TBD** -  Problem Set 5 <!-- [Problem Set 5](/problem_sets/problem_set_5.ipynb) -->
9.  **Due Midnight PST on TBD** -  Problem Set 6 <!-- [Problem Set 6](/problem_sets/problem_set_6.ipynb) -->
10. **Reviewing TBD** - Final Practice Problems <!-- [Final Practice Problems](/problem_sets/final_practice_problems.ipynb) -->

All problem set solutions should be submitted on Canvas directly as a `.ipynb` file with instructions embedded.

## Software and Programming Environment
For the computational environment, it is strongly suggested to install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as well as Jupyter.  Familiarity with those tools will make it easier for future work in industry or as research assistants.  See [here](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/getting_started.html) to setup your environment.

While we will be using a computer for simulations and numerical solutions to our models, this is an economics course.  If you have the prerequisites, then **do not be scared off by the programming requirements!**  Relative to many classes, the coding will be kept simple.  The hard part will be the economic and finance theory.
